# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures

This repository is for practice with regards to data structures, algorithms, and various mathematics for interview practice and personal projects.  Here, there will be implementations of well-known algorithms, data structures, and functions that I can use to solve other problems as well as sloppy testing and more robust unittesting of the algorithms and data structures.  

I used a lot of these structures and functions repeatedly in solving Project Euler Questions and it got annoying to find what project I implemented what structure of function in, so this repository is a direct consequence of that, i.e. an easy place to find modular functions or structures for general use, but these are general structures or algorithms, not specific solutions to Project Euler questions, so this repository will remain public.
